I finally converted the last of my old Flash games into React, using Next JS.

For simplicity, instead of symbols, I used emojis to hide the message.

It’s not perfect, but the basic functionality is there. Maybe in the future I’ll improve it.

The objective of the game is to reveal the quote. Each symbol corresponds to a letter (simple substitution cypher).

I also tried to make it as accessible as possible, but by the nature of the puzzle, it would probably not be very playable with a screen reader. The symbols are buttons, so they are accessible by tabbing.

It’s playable on mobile, but it needs more work to improve the experience.
